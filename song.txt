This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls that's a tandem
She gon' do all it for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah, I'm young, rich, and handsome
Uh, this shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son, yeah
This shit is not random
Woah okay

It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she gon' be ready when I slide through

and
